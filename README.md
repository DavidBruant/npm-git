# npm-git

npm-git is an experiment

It aims at being a drop-in replacement for npm but that is independent from the [npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org/)

It heavily relies on the fact that npm can install [dependencies hosted on git repositories](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependencies) (like github and gitlab and private git repos)

... but maybe this is less important than [something else](https://github.com/DavidBruant/contained-node-packages) for now. Especially if packages were to stopped being stored from a centralized place
